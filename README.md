## C# Microservice

**This system I have created is a system developed for users of two different coffee companies. While both companies want their users to register to the system and save these records to the database, one of the companies wants to determine whether the registered user is a real person before the registration process. A microservice called MERNIS was used for this determination process. With this service, it is determined whether the user is a real person or not and the registration process is carried out according to the result of this process.**
